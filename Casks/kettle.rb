  caveats <<~EOS
    Kettle registers hooks in your Claude Code settings when you set it up.
    Before uninstalling, choose Settings, General, Uninstall Kettle in the app,
    then Quit Kettle. It removes its own parts from your settings and keeps
    your later changes. Or, with Kettle quit:
      #{appdir}/Kettle.app/Contents/MacOS/Kettle --uninstall-hooks
